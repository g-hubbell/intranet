About Kratom
Native to the Southeast Asia, kratom (Mitragyna Speciosa) is a powerful medicinal plant used by thousands throughout the world. The medicinal potentials of this plant are vast, some of the most prominent include: pain relief, opiate addiction treatment, mood lifting, energy and immune system stimulation.
There are entire forums on the use and benefits of this impressive plant, which speaks for this plant’s virtue more than we ever could.




Origins & Locale
The use of kratom goes back several thousand years, but it was first formally documented growing abundantly in Thailand by Dutch botanist Pieter Willem Korthals in the early 19th century.
While the birthplace of Mitragyna Speciosa is unknown,  it has flourished abundantly in Southeast Asia and Indochina — growing naturally in regions such as:
* Thailand
* Indonesia
* Malaysia
* Sumatra
* Java
* Bali
* Borneo
* The Sunda isles.
Due to growing in these distinctly different areas, the plant has evolved to adapt to its environment, making kratom leaves from varied in effects and potency. We will cover these strain differences at length to give you a better understanding of the versatility and applications of this plant.



Uses of Kratom
The medicinal effects of kratom are highly flexible and diverse due to its unique alkaloid profile, which is unlike any other plant known to exist. These effects are:
* Pain relief
* Opiate withdrawal relief
* Opiate maintenance /transitional substance
* Mood-lifting
* Energy Promotion
* Anxiolytic (Anti-Anxiety)
* Depression Relief
* Insomnia Relief
* Immune System Stimulation
* Nootropic (Cognition Enhancing)
* Anti-leukemic
* Anti-malarial
* Anti-inflammatory
* Lowers blood sugar
In addition to this large range of medicinal applications, this plant also has other positive secondary properties such as high-antioxant and vitamin content, which has made it worthwhile for general health purposes as well. Kratom is safe in almost every regard, as there have been no known deaths from this plant, except in combination with other dangerous substances.

Pain Relief
Kratom’s pain-killing effects are very pronounced, and are much more effective than OTC substances when dealing with chronic pain. Many people have become entirely pharmaceutical free thanks to it’s pain-killing effects.
As awareness increases, expect to see this plant as a commonplace alternative to opiate medication.
Kratom can effectively reduce pain from conditions such as:
* Migraines
* Cluster Headaches
* Back Pain
* Minor Injuries: Burns, Scrapes, Broken Bones
* Arthritis
* Multiple Sclerosis
* Carpal Tunnel
* Torn Muscles
* Scoliosis
* Neck Pain & Soreness
* Abdominal Pain
* Chest Pain
Besides these, there are many more areas in which using kratom for pain can be effective.
Strains for Pain
The primary reason kratom is so effective for pain are it’s two primary painkilling alkaloids: Mitragynine, and 7-OH-mitragynine. Which have agonist activity at mu and delta opiod receptors, effectively dampening the body’s perception of pain. As a result, those who are looking for pain relief from kratom have had best effects with strains high in these two alkaloids.
Leaf alkaloid content can vary from plant to plant, and from strain to strain, however, there are a few strains which seem to be the most effective for pain overall. The most popular strains for this purpose are:
Strains
1. Borneo
2. Indo
3. Maeng Da
4. Bali
Preferred Vein Color
* Red
Dosage
* Moderate/High



Kratom and Opiate Withdrawal/Addiction
Because of this plant’s pain-killing and mood-lifting effects, it has been used effectively to quit opiates and dampen withdrawal symptoms for both prescribed pain medication and illegal narcotics.
You can find many cases of people using kratom for opiate withdrawal and addiction to both help transition to sobriety, and to combat cravings and post acute withdrawals as a maintenance substance.
Strains
1. Borneo
2. Bali
3. Indo
4. Maeng Da (Situational)
Preferred Strain Color
* Red
Dosage
* Moderate/High



Psychological Effects (Anxiety, Depression and Mood-Lifting)
The psychological effects of kratom are of a very unique nature in comparison to other plants found in nature, contain both sedating and stimulating properties; these effects can differ depending on the strain, plant and one’s own personal chemistry.
Nearly any strain can cause general mood-lifting, but the differences in strain can shift the spectrum of effects between stimulating and sedating.
Depression
According to uses, this plant may also be beneficial for the treatment of depression; however, not every strain is fit for this purpose. The more sedating strains may have some temporary effects on depression, but are lacking in effectiveness long term.
Strains
1. Thai
2. Maeng Da
3. Green Malaysian
Preferred Vein Color
* White
Dosage
* Moderate
Some green vein strains have been used for well-rounded depression relief, though individual brain-chemistry may come into play.
Anxiety Relief
There are several ways to maximize anxiety relief through kratom — the ideal strain for anxiety relief is a borneo strain, though other sedating strains can work effectively, and can also double as a great kratom for sleep. A borneo kratom strain has a subtle, yet powerful effect of destroying anxiety and restlessness better than nearly any other strain.
Strains
1. Borneo
2. Indo
3. Bali
Preferred Vein Color
* Red
Dosage
*  Moderate

Immune System Stimulation
Due to the immunostimulant alkaloids found in kratom:
* Isopteropodine
* Isorhynchophylline
* Isomitraphylline
* Mitraphylline
Kratom can be extremely effective for boosting the immune system for conditions ranging from the common cold to the flu, or even more serious conditions. Because of this, many have learned to take it at the onset of a sickness to dramatically reduce its duration.
Strains
1. Green Malaysian
2. Borneo
Preferred Vein Color
* Green Vein
Dosage 
* – Moderate – Low



Nootropic (Cognition Enhancing) Effects
Nootropic substances are a relatively new field of interest, yet it shows much promise. Interestingly, due to strain differences, it has been used as a nootropic in several different areas, such as focus and memory.
Unlike traditional medications for focus, kratom doesn’t make your focus “stick” psychologically, rather it dampens psychological background noise, promoting natural focus ability.
Because strain differences can vary, there is typically no set dose for peak cognition boosting effects — though it typically ranges from low/medium to medium.
Strains
1. Green Malaysian (Focus)
2. Thai (Focus/Energy)
3. Maeng Da (Focus/Energy)
Preferred Vein Color
* White
* Green
Dosage
* Low – Moderate
 



Strain Analysis
Due to different growth regions and breeding, kratom has evolved into a variety of different strains, which can be very different in effects. There are three primary effect categories one can divide strains into: stimulating, sedating and moderate.
It should be noted that every plants within a strain can vary, so in no way are these analyses set in stone, rather they based upon an average of verifiable user reports to provide a guide to the strain as a whole.

Stimulating Strains
Stimulating strains are some of the most desirable strains for those with fatigue or depression, as well as for those who need to sustain energy and focus for long periods of time.
 
Thai Kratom
Thai kratom is well-known for its powerful energetic effects. The unique alkaloid profile of Thai kratom often provokes different reactions between different users, and may not be for everyone. However, this strain has a very dedicated following, unlike anything we have seen with other varieties of kratom.
The pain-killing effects of Thai are variable; typically, red vein thai (commonly called RVT) is the most effective in regards to analgesia, whereas white and green vein thai strains, while stimulating and a great kratom strain for depression, are lacking in this area.
Stimulation: 8 to 9.5 / 10
Pain Relief: 4 – 8 / 10 
Mood: 6 – 9 / 10
 
Maeng Da Kratom
Maeng Da has been widely renowned as one of the most potent strains of kratom, and for good reason — it can provide both high levels of pain relief and stimulation. This strain has been ideal for those with pain who don’t want to sacrifice energy levels, as well as those who are looking for a mood-boost.
Stimulation: 7 – 8.5 / 10
Pain Relief – 7.5 – 10 / 10
Mood: 7.5 – 10 / 10



Sedating Strains
As a whole, sedating strains are lacking in the more stimulating alkaloids, primarily mitragynine, contained in the  Thai/Maeng Da strains of kratom; however, they pack a very large punch as far as pain relief is concerned due to their large concentrations of  7-hydroxymitragynine. These strains have been traditionally used for chronic pain, opiate withdrawal relief and mood-lifting.
 
Borneo Kratom
A true borneo strain, especially a red vein borneo, is one of the most unique and strongest strains of kratom you will find in nature; they are highly sedating, great for pain relief, and unparalleled for anxiety/stress relief.
Borneo strains also have a extremely low side-effect factor in comparison to other strains of its type. Once experienced, you can quickly distinguish a true borneo by its unique smell.
Stimulation: 1 – 2/10
Pain Relief: 8-10 / 10
Mood: 8 – 10 / 10
Bali Kratom
Bali kratom is one of the most economical strains due to large leaves and quick growth. Proper dosage for some Bali strains can be difficult, as they are known for their low “wobble” threshold. Though many have found one can reverse this negative by mixing it with another strain.
Stimulation: 2-4 / 10
Pain Relief: 7 – 9.5 / 10
Mood:  7 – 9.5 / 10
Indo Kratom
Indo strains are very well-rounded for pain and have less side-effects than comparable Balinese strains, and can be further sub-categorized as strains such as riau and sumatra, even borneo is a type of indo. Many have reported delayed effects from many types of Indo kratom, which is likely due to the leaves tough cell-walls, very similar to Green Malaysian strains.
While the effects are similar to Borneo kratom strains on paper, experienced users will notice the unique differences that make this strain so unique.
Stimulation: 2-3 / 10
Pain Relief: 8 – 10 / 10
Mood: 8 – 10 / 10

Moderate Strains
Many prefer a moderate strain as their daily go-to, due to its potent, yet smooth, effects. Currently, the most popular moderate strain is Green Malaysian; however, other sub-strains, vein types and breeding can make an overall sedating or stimulating strain moderate.
Green Malaysian
Green Malaysian has long been known as one of the longest-lasting strains due to leaf  cell-wall density.
Many remark on this strain’s unique nootropic effects, which, despite heavy stimulation, can increase focus and patience for quite long periods of time. Interestingly, these effects are typically only noticed in retrospect due to its smooth character of effects.
Stimulation: 4-6 / 10
Pain Relief: 6 – 8 / 10
Mood: 7 – 8.5 / 10



Vein Types: Effects & Analysis
Something unique to this plant, in comparison to many other medicinal plants, is the distinct differences of vein color; which has corresponding effects and growth conditions. While each vein color tends to have a unique set of effects that can provide clues to the effects that the strain has.
However, there are some minor exceptions, especially when dealing with strains with a less balanced alkaloid profile such as Thai, or Borneo strains which on the whole provide a kratom experience that is stimulating or sedating, respectively.
 
Red Vein Kratom
Red vein kratom is one of the most popular due to its natural tendency toward higher levels of  7-hydroxymitragynine, which leads to impressive pain-killing effects, sedation, as well as anxiety and stress relief.
Red veins also tends to be less at the mercy of individual brain chemistry; whereas white and green vein strains often effect people variably.
This is one of the reasons red vein thai (RVT) is so popular among kratom users –it combines both heavy levels of energy from it’s Thai influences, with the red vein painkilling effects —  leaving the strain stimulating but very well-rounded.
Pain Relief: 3/3
Energy: 1/3
 
White Vein Kratom
Despite the lower amount of 7-hydroxymitragynine found in white vein strains, this vein type should not be treated lightly. White vein kratom has a very strong following, and can be highly effective for conditions such as depression and lack of focus/energy.
Of all the vein types, white vein shows the most potential as a nootropic (cognition enhancing) substance. Many have found that using this vein type first thing in the morning to be a great substitute for coffee due to it’s “clean” effects on alertness and focus.
Pain Relief: 1/3
Energy: 3/3
 
Green Vein Kratom
For those who prefer neither the sedation of red veins, or the stimulation of white veins, green vein kratom may be the best solution. Green vein strains are much more moderate in their effects than other the other vein varieties and can provide the best of both worlds, making them commonly used as a daily kratom.
Green vein strains can also provide nootropic effects, and are generally less at the whim of personal brain chemistry than white vein strains tend to be.
Pain Relief: 2/3
Energy: 1.5/3

Extract Guide
While typically not as well-rounded as the plain leaf in effects, kratom extracts can certainly serve a purpose for those with chronic pain or other debilitating conditions in which the plain leaf will not suffice.
There are a large variety of different types of extracts with varying effects, based upon both the method of extraction as well as the base plant material used to make them. Read below to learn about these different extract types.
 
Water-Based Extracts
Water-based kratom extracts are by far the most common variety. As the name implies, the extract is performed by:  dissolving a portion of alkaloids into water, straining the powder, and evaporating the water. This process leaves a  brownish, more alkaloid-concentrated version of the plain leaf behind.
Water extracts are commonly referred to with an ‘x’ (e.g. 10x, 25x), which implies how much plain leaf material was used to create the same weight of resulting extract. Sadly, these figures are nearly always incorrect due to vendor dishonesty.
Pros:
* More alkaloid-concentrated than plain leaf
* Can be used in addition to plain leaf to potentiate effects
* Relatively side-effect free in comparison to resin and full-spectrum extracts
* More stimulating than the plain-leaf base material
* Ability to dissolve in water
Cons:
* Typically not very effective unless taken in conjunction with plain leaf
* Not a well-rounded extract in terms of effects (less pain-killing effect and sedation)
* High price per potency
* Can increase tolerance
 
Kratom Resin Extracts
In comparison to water-based extractions, kratom resin extractions have a much more well-rounded profile of effects. These extracts are typically performed by extracting kratom with both a polar solvent and a non-polar solvent; a simple example of this would be water and ethanol. Like the water extract, the powder is strained and the alkaloid saturated non-polar/polar solvent is left to dry.
Pros:
* Full-spectrum of effects
* Ease of use
* Easy storage
* High potency per weight
Cons:
* More expensive than plain leaf
* Side-effects to potency ratio comparable to plain leaf
* Temperature sensitive (melts in minor heat)
 
Kratom Tinctures
Unlike the other forms of extracts, kratom tinctures can vary in their method of extraction and their potency; because of this, buying them from an disreputable source can leave one disappointed. On the other hand, when they are done well, they can be quite potent.
Pros:
* Ease of Use
* Fast-acting
* Convenience of storage
Cons:
* Typically expensive
* Variable Potency
* Rarely provide a full-spectrum of effects
* Rapid development of tolerance
 
Enhanced Leaf
Enhanced leaf has become the go-to choice of many extract users due to it’s high potency and lack of side effects. Enhanced leaf is used by taking a highly potent kratom extract, dissolving it in a solution, soaking kratom leaves/powder in this solution and letting it dry. When done correctly, this method can create a highly potent leaf.
One of the most popular enhanced leaf blends of our era is known as UEI (Ultra Enhanced Indo).
Pros:
* Very potent when done well
* Lack of side-effects per potency
* Typically well-rounded
* Highly effective for pain
Cons:
* Rapid development of tolerance
* Can cause some withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt cessation after prolonged use
* Relatively high price

Kratom’s Alkaloids
The reason for the difference in effects from strain to strain is the variability of kratom’s alkaloids; in fact, there are  over 28 identified alkaloids found within the plant with different half-lives and durations. For more information on these alkaloids, their effects, and their content (% of total alkaloid weight, one standard deviation), refer below:
* 7-hydroxymitragynine – Analgesic/painkiller (opiod receptor agonist), antidiarrheal, antitussive – 1.5 – 2.5%
* Mitragynine – Analgesic/painkiller (opiod receptor agonist), antidiarrheal, antitussive, adrenergic receptor agonist (mild stimulant), antimalarial – 40 – 75% [Lowest recorded content: 12%]
* Speciogynine – Smooth Muscle Relaxer – 6.5 – 7.2%
* Mitraphylline – Muscle relaxer, vasodilator, anti-hypertensive, anti-amnesic, immune system stimulant, anti-leukemic – less than 1%
* Epicatechin (EGC) – Antioxidant, antiviral, anti-mutagenic, anti-leukemic, anti inflammatory, anti-diabetic. Commonly found in green tea. – 1%
* 9-Hydroxycorynantheidine – Painkiller/analgesic – 1%
* Corynantheidine – Mu opiod Antagonist – less than 1%
* Isomitraphylline – Immune System Stimulant – less than 1%
* Isomitrafoline – Immune System Stimulant – less than 1%
* Isorhynchophylline – Immune System Stimulant – less than 1%
* Isopteropodine – Immune System Stimulant – less than 1%
* Ciliaphylline – Analgesic, antitussive – less than 1%
* Corynoxine A – Dopamine Mediator – less than 1%
* Corynoxine B – Dopamine Mediator – less than 1%
* Ajmalicine – Sedative (Anti-Adrenergic), increase blood flow to brain, smooth muscle relaxer – less than 1%
* Rhynchophylline – Anti-inflammatory, vasodilator, anti-hypertensive – less than 1%
* Speciociliatine – Mild opiod receptor agonist – less than 1%
* Speciophylline – Anti-leukemic – less than 1%
* Tetrahydroalstonine – Anti-adrenergic, lowers blood sugar – less than 1%
* Akuammigine – inactive – less than 1%
* Mitrafoline – inactive – less than 1%
* Mitraversine – inactive – less than 1%
* Speciofoline – inactive – less than 1%
* Stipulatine – inactive – less than 1%
Known kratom researchers such as Takayama H, Shellard EJ, Raymond-Hamet, Becket AH, Philipson JD and Lee CM, have shown that the alkaloid profiles of the plants from different regions vary heavily; especially in Thai strains, in which case mitragynine content  is well above the average. Malaysian strains, on the other hand, have proportionally low levels of mitragynine, suggesting its potency is due to proportionally higher levels of 7-hydroxymitragynine.
These differences in alkaloid profile are what make each strain unique and effective in quite different ways, but there is still much research to be done until we have a complete understanding of alkaloid effects, and an alkaloid profile of each strain, region and vein color.



Traditional Dosage
Dosage has been a key factor for those looking for specific effects. By dosing too low, the medicinal capabilities are nulled, while dosing too high can often lead to relatively harmless, but potentially unpleasant side-effects, such as the “wobbles” and minor nausea. To learn about kratom dosage, refer below.
Average Dosage by Grams
* Mild – 1 to 2 grams
* Moderate – 2-4.5 grams
* High – 4.5 – 8 grams
Average Dosage by Teaspoon
* Mild – .5  to .9 tsp
* Moderate – 1 to 2 tsp
* High – 2 to 3.5 tsp
It should be noted that due to varying potency between strains and plants, this estimate is in no way standardized, instead it an estimate based on historical and experiential reports. Doses at the the “high” end of the spectrum are also much more likely to cause side-effects, depending upon the strain.
Dosage Intervals
For best effect, many have found that this plant should not be taken in high doses regularly, as some of the medicinal effects can diminish. However, those who use this plant to combat chronic pain may find this inevitable, as pain doesn’t operate in a convenient time-cycle.
Strain Differences
Differences between strains is a factor that can’t be overlooked when calculating a dosage. There are a few primary strains that should be dosed relatively lower than the average, these strains are:
* Maeng Da – Potent, active at lower doses
* Bali – Side effects encountered at lower doses in comparison to other strains
* Thai – Can be overstimulating for some at higher doses
Because of this, it is a good idea to modify dosage with these strains accordingly in order to achieve best results. Some strains, such as Borneo, can be dosed relatively higher, due to their lack of side-effects. Because of this variability in strains, it is advisable to start low with any new or unknown strain.
Effects By Dosage
Something that is frequently encountered with a variety of strains is the difference in effects at differing doses. Although this varies depending upon the strain and where you buy kratom, typically, lower doses are relatively more stimulating than higher doses; while the cause of this is not well known, it likely has to do with the sedation curve of 7-hydroxymitragynine.
For anyone  inexperienced with kratom, it is essential to know about the philosophy, theory and advice regarding kratom dosage.
The “Less is More” Theory
The “less is more” theory is very popular among kratom forums, and there is some evidence to back this theory. Almost every strain has an optimal dose for both medicinal and euphoric effects, and dosage above this ideal threshold can have reverse effects due to mu opiod antagonists such as corynantheidine.
Now, it’s important to note that different strains have differing levels of this alkaloid, so this statement may not apply to all strains, however, the majority of strains are affected.
The “less is more” theory, is also advisable because lower dosage also creates less tolerance to effects, which can increase the plant’s medicinal potential over time.
Empty Stomach
As plain leaf has to be digested in order to have medicinal benefit,  it is considered best taken on an empty stomach, as this will ensure the effects are delivered quickly and properly.
Because eating is a necessity, it may not always be possible to  use it in this manner; for this reason, many have made kratom tea to deliver effects more quickly.

Kratom Preparation – Traditional and Modern Methods
Throughout the thousands of years kratom has been used, preparation methods have remained relatively the same; however, as western society has interacted with this plant, there have been some unique additions —  recipes and methods to fit our unique needs.
The Kratom Quid
The quid is the original method of kratom use for Southeast Asian cultures, especially Thailand. The quid method of use involves taking fresh kratom leaves (a rare commodity in the western world), removing the stems and veins in one quick motion, bundling the kratom and chewing it while holding the saliva and chewed leaf material in their mouth.
The quid works through mostly sublingual methods, however, the swallowed portion also has a considerable effect.
Toss and Wash Method
One of the most common kratom preparation methods, if it could be called preparation at all, is the toss ‘n’ wash. This method is typically done by:
* Putting water (or other liquid) in the mouth
* Adding desired kratom dose to this water
* Submerging and mixing the kratom/water mixture within the mouth to avoid dry particles getting caught in the mouth and throat
* Taking another gulp of water while simultaneously swallowing the mixture
* Chasing with more water to get down any debris
 
Kratom Tea
This is another very common preparation method, both in the west and east. Learning how to make kratom tea is fairly simple:
* Add water to pot (3-10 ounces)
* Add desired kratom dose
* Simmer for 15 – 45 minutes (20 minutes typically suffices)
* Optional: strain powder
Tea is considered effective by many because of the quick onset of effects; however, by straining out the powder, one may lose the full alkaloid spectrum of the plain leaf, reducing some medicinal potentials.
Tea Tips
* Adding water to kratom powder and freezing prior to making tea can increase the amount of alkaloids absorbed
* Adding lemon juice, or small amounts of citric acid can also increase amount of alkaloids absorbed
* One can salvage the strained powder from tea and reuse it to ensure no alkaloids are wasted
 
Kratom Tea Recipes
Because some are more sensitive to the bitter taste of kratom tea, many tea recipes have been developed. One of the most effective we have seen for masking the taste of kratom is to mix it with a flavoring, or mixture.
Speciosa Chai
One of the most effective kratom recipes we have found is what we have heard called “Speciosa Chai”. This method is very simple and is composed of a few simple steps:
* Condense kratom tea to 3-4 ounces
* Add 4-5 ounces of Chai tea mixture
* Add sugar & cream/milk if desired
There are a variety of different chai mixtures one can experiment with; however, the Tazo Organic Chai Black Tea mix is the favorite we have seen at an associated kava bar in our area.
Simple Flavorings
Something that we have seen to be surprisingly effective at masking the taste  are pump flavorings– especially the fruit-based flavorings. You can find these pump flavorings at local coffee shops or online for a very reasonable cost.
Mixtures & Blends
Another common method that has been more recently for those who don’t want to toss ‘n’ wash or make tea, is to mix kratom. Some of the most common mixers we have heard are:
* Yogurt
* Applesauce
* Peanut Butter
* Honey
* Juice
* Chocolate Milk
Mixing kratom with these has the added benefit of allowing it to be taken while minimizing the taste, however, with some of these it may take longer to digest.
Another creative method we have heard is to kratom with peanut butter to form little peanut butter balls to swallow. Nearly any decent tasting drink/mixture can be effective.
Additionally, tools such as blender bottles, commonly used for protein shakes, have been suggested for this process.
Kratom Capsules
A common form of kratom preparation is by capping the kratom powder rather than taking it whole, mixed or in tea form. Kratom capsules have the benefit of being easy to use.
Considerations
Buying capsules can be extremely expensive in comparison to powder, and it is kratom capsules, especially the variety sold at more unsavory stores and gas stations that have had a big part in giving kratom a bad name. Additionally, when buying these capsules you don’t really know what you’re getting, as it isn’t an approved dietary supplement; which could lead to dangers for both the user, and kratom’s legality.
Because of this, anyone who wants to keep kratom legal should avoid buying kratom capsules. There are a large variety of capsule tools, such as “The Capsule Machine” and “Cap m Quick”, which can make capsules in bulk.

Reducing Kratom Tolerance
Kratom tolerance is the number one impediment when looking to ensure peak medicinal effects. Besides taking this plant less frequently, there are some tricks one can use to keep tolerance low.
Strain Rotation
Strain rotation is a fantastic way to keep the medicinal effects of kratom fresh. When using a specific strain for a long period, you can develop a tolerance to its specific alkaloid profile; however, by switching strains daily, the alkaloid levels do not remain stable enough to develop a full tolerance to the effects.
Methods
* Rotation by Effects – This method involves using alternating strains types (e.g. Mon. – Sedating, Tues. – Stimulating, Weds. – Sedating)
* Rotation by Vein Color – Similar to the above method, this involves rotating by vein color (e.g. Mon. – Red, Tues. – White, Weds. – Green)
By using these methods, one can ensure that the alkaloid profiles are as varied as possible on consecutive days, which can keep tolerance at bay for a much longer period of time.
Note: Stem and vein kratom is often used as a substitute to further reduce tolerance, as its alkaloid profile is typically very different than the plain leaf.
However, because using this technique to it’s fullest requires 3-5+ different strains, this method of tolerance reduction, may not fit the means of everyone.
Supplementation
There are a variety of other ways to supplement tolerance reduction, including:
* Magnesium
Magnesium supplementation is a great way to keep kratom tolerance low due to its NMDA antagonist effects, which are the primary opiod tolerance regulators.
There are many studies supporting this, one of which can be found in April 1998’s publication of Anesthesia & Analgesia.
* Exercise
Exercise is a very effective yet under rated method of reducing tolerance. Exercise’s reduction of tolerance is cumulative, meaning the more you exercise, and the more in shape you are, the less tolerance is developed, which potentiates the medicinal effects of kratom.



The Infamous “Wobbles”
The “Wobbles” is a term that was coined within kratom communities to describe the most prominent side effect of kratom, especially Bali strains. The wobbles are defined by the difficulty to focus the eyes at a specific point without strain and annoyance; this effect can lead to headaches and nausea.
While the wobbles are not much more than an annoyance, driving or operating other heavy machinery while experiencing the wobbles is dangerous, and should never be attempted.
Avoiding the Wobbles
The easiest way to avoid the wobbles is to keep dosage below the side effect threshold. This threshold can vary between strains and plants. Typically, doses under 5 grams will not cause the wobbles.
Strains by Wobble Factor
* Bali – High
* Green Malaysian – Moderate/High
* Indo – Moderate
* Maeng Da – Moderate
* Thai – Moderate/Low
* True Borneo – Low
Note: It is almost impossible to experience the wobbles with strained kratom tea; leading many to believe that it is an effect caused by one of the fat-soluble alkaloids.
Combating the Wobbles
While there is not much information available on combating the wobbles, there are a few things that can help in the process.
* Activated Charcoal – This supplement is one of the most effective ways to get rid of the wobbles; it works by adsorbing a  portion of the wobble-causing alkaloids, negating the effects almost entirely.
* Food/Carbonated Drinks – While these won’t help get rid of the wobbles, they can speed up digestion, allowing the symptoms to pass more quickly, if inevitable.

Origins of Maeng Da
Maeng Da is very unique among kratom strains, and has generally been considered one of the most potent, but what how did Maeng Da rise to such popularity? The history of the strain is obscure, however, we do have some interesting information regarding it’s origins.  According to several kratom fans, there is an very unique story tied to this plant.
The origin of the Maeng Da strain is said to be tied to a specific plantation in Indonesia, known to themselves as the “World’s First Legal Kratom Plantation.” At this point, kratom was legal in nearly all countries besides Thailand, yet for some reason, they stuck with the name.
This plantation heavily marketed their product as “Genetically Grown”, which is why, to this day, some (incorrectly) say that Maeng Da is genetically engineered; yet there is a world of difference between GMO kratom, and “genetically grown” kratom.
From reports, their goal was to create the perfect Thai strain through a process called “grafting”, common in other horticultural trades. Grafting is the process of inserting the vascular tissues of one plant into another in hopes they inosculate — creating  a strong, early-maturing kratom tree while combining traits of two individual plants.
The grafting had great effects for the “Worlds First Legal Kratom Plantation,” and they named the potent strain produced from this method, “Maeng Da”, which is the word for a large, edible beetle as well as a derogatory term for a pimp.
Over time, the strain produced from this plant it was lost, and the term Maeng Da quickly changed to define a highly potent kratom, typically a strong Red Vein Thai or a strong horned kratom variety.
While the term Maeng Da, does not necessarily mean the same thing that it used to, it is still a term used to refer to most potent forms of kratom available.
